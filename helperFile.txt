This project uses a combination of Python and R. The Pandas library cleans up the activity data while excluding from an exlusion list.
R is used to auto generate graphs based on this data. There are multiple graphs per program.

This data uses inferential categorization when consider what program a staff memeber works for. The script assigns a program type to a staff member based on how many clients they interacted that belong to a program.
If a staff member has a very low amount of submitted activities or they interact with clients across many programs, the inference may be incorrect.
But this inference method allows comparison with today's data with historical data.

What you need:

1. Download activities from the data range you need form Civi using the bulk activities report, specifically "Activities - Merrill" report. Call this file "data.csv"
2. Check the exclusionList.txt file to see what activities are excluded. Add onto the list to exclude any activities from the report.
3. Open up the R file "GeneralActivityPrep_r_script.Rmd" in R studio.
4. Run the script, and it will generate multipel graphs per program while exlcuding everything from the list.
